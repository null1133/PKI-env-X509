In this hands-on activity, we are asked to create a PKI environment consisting of a Certificate Authority (CA), Registration Authority (RA), and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL). We must issue x.509 certificates to users, validate certificate requests, and manage certificate revocation. In addition, We must configure secure communication channels using SSL/TLS.
We must perform the necessary configuration to issue and validate a certificate. Also, with respect to the SSL certificate, we must be able to obtain `.cert` files, note their contents, and verify the validity of the certificate.
